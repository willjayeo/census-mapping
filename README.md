# census-mapping
Create geospatial visualisations with UK census data.

This is very much a work in progress. The plan is to create tools for managing census data, with a collection of scripts for analysing and visualising.

## Instalation

Clone this repositiory. Make this repository your working directory and run the following:

```
pip install .
```

## Usage

Access census data from [NOMIS](nomisweb.co.uk).

### Interactive choropleth map

Create a choropleth [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) map from a graduated census data field.

See usage instructions [here](docs/make_leaflet_map.md).
